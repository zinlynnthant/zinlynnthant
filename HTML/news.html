          The new branding features a circle and two lines, which are said to
          represent a burger and two French fries. The company has not yet
          revealed the name of the chain, although a number of options have
          reportedly been considered. In May, McDonald's said it would pull out
          of Russia over the Ukraine war.

        <p>
          Friday is the first day to start procedures needed for the entry and
          arrivals are not expected until late June at the earliest, even though
          airport immigration and quarantine offices stood by for any possible
          arrivals. The Japan Tourism Agency says tours are being accepted from
          98 countries and regions, including the United States, Britain, China,
          South Korea, Thailand and Singapore, which are deemed as having low
          infection risks.
